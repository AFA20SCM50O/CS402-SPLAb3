# CS402-SPLAb3
For this lab, you will implement a program that reads data from a file and computes some basic statistical analysis measures for the data.  The program should work without any changes for data sets of any size, i.e. it would work for 10 data values or for 10 million without re-compilation. 

To Launch type the following in your terminal:

1. gcc -o basicstats basicstats.c
2. ./basicstats <input.txt>
